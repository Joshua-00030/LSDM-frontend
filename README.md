# Getting Started with Project Trace
To run Project Trace locally simply clone this github and then run:

npm install

npm start

This will create a frontend development server. As this project is hosted by vercel no build file is created locally. one can be created using:

npm build

The database connection cannot be made public, meaning custom forks of this project must create their own database and adjust their API calls to said database.

A similar backend can be created by using the code found at:
